# Cards-Shuffle-Golang

This is a simple Go Project I got from Udemy by Stephen Girder that shuffles a deck of cards ( 16 card deck only)

The reason we stopped at 16 is that this project could have got very complicated by the way i used slicing strings 

we would have have to mainpulate ACE OF Spades the of on both sides to view the actualy single card.

Go has a solutuon for this which is a data struct. by a suit of typecard witha value os ace and a suit of spades..

somthing like that 


Go has a also makest testing you project easy which is built into vscode out of the box

One of the  reason I like golang is the execptional official documentation
